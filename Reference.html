	<h1>PREFACE</h1>
<p><strong>Life</strong> is a journey. We journey through it by checking the choices we make, just like checking the directions on a map. We check continuously, to ensure we are still on the right path.</p>
	
	<p><strong>With</strong> time, we may memorise our tracks, and, without much thought, take decisions based on our past experiences.
Yet, there always comes a time when we must stop, look around, and figure out where we are and how on earth we got here. We may dillydally for days before continuing the journey, reluctant to leave a particular memory, or we may pause for a moment and dash on, intent on reaching some set goal. These pauses are moments when we journey back into our past to glean from some of the happenings in our lives to help us take better decisions in our present.</p>
	
	
<p><strong>Choosing</strong> a school, a spouse, a job, or becoming a parent are critical milestones in life’s journey. Moments like these call for hours of reflection to determine whether we are about to take the right steps, rather than make the same mistakes of yesteryears. At these times, we look into the past for guidance, and hope not to make the same mistakes.
In 2022 I found myself in one of these moments. I had to make two critical decisions that would shape the rest of not only my life, but also that of my wife and children. Thinking about the decisions I needed to make took me on a reflective journey into the past, and I began counting the number of things I wish I had known before that moment.</p>
 
	
<p><strong>While</strong> in my thoughts, I recalled a quote in an email a friend had sent me some years ago – one of those motivational emails. This particular one was entitled the “Story of Rose”. (You will find this story on page 105. If you want, you can go have a read and return, I will wait.) The line from that story which jumped into my thoughts was this: “People usually do not regret what they did, but most of the time, what they did not do.”
Having experienced life for over forty-plus years, I agree that we often regret what we failed to do. But thinking more about it, is it that we did not know how to do those things and subsequently did not do them? Or did we not even know we had to do them?

<p>This book is a compilation of some of the lessons life has taught me over time, and my reasons for wishing I had learned them earlier. I wrote most of these lessons in 2010, and they lingered in my Google Drive for years. Finally, in 2022, twelve full years later, I found the courage to share my reflections with the world as a hard copy book.
I sincerely hope you will find some valuable lessons here and apply them. I encourage you to share your thoughts and opinions with me through my email, <em><strong>samuelwalker415@gmail.com</strong></em>, and together, we can chart a better course for our lives, and hope to have fewer regrets in the years ahead.</p>
